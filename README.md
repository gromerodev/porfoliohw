Here i created a variable called hoverboards set to 0 using the var declaration.
Created control flow logic for the following

"if the hoverboards is greater than OR equal to 100 - then log "The future rocks!"

if hoverboards is less than 100 AND hoverboards is greater than 1 - then log "The future is pretty cool"

if hoverboards is exactly equal to 1 - then log "Meh"

otherwise log "The future is boring."
